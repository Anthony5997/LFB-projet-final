== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I do not receive notification via email when the form is submitted. What can I do? =

Check please the following tutorial that should help find and solve the issue:
<a href="https://help.flothemes.com/article/533-troubleshooting-floforms-issues" target="_blank">Flo Forms email issues</a>

= Does the plugin have any dependency on anything ? =

By default it doesn't. But if you want to add captcha to fight the spam, then you must have a <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/#" target="_blank">Google</a> account and set up reCAPTCHA API keys.

= The form stopped working, what can I do ? =

There may be various reasons, but one common problem happens when adding SSL certificate to the website, and the WordPress address URL is not updated to contain 'https'.
So if the SSL certificate was added, make sure these settings have also 'https': <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Lc2Aepv.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/Lc2Aepv.jpg</a>
If the problem persists, check the console and see if there are any Javascript errors.
